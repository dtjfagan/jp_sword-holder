This holds all of my design data for a Japanese style katana wall mount

I have a katana I brought from Japan many moons ago and I have never hung it up on the wall.
Additionally, we have a Super Fab Lab and I wanted to update and sharpen my skills in there. So I thought it might give me a change to kill two birds with one stone.
